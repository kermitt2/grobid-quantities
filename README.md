__Work in progress.__

The goal of this GROBID module is to recognize in textual documents any expressions of measurements (e.g. _pressure_, _temperature_, etc.), to parse and normalization them, and finally to convert these measurements into SI units. 
We focus our work on technical and scientific articles (text, XML and PDF input) and patents (text and XML input).

As part of this task we support the recognition of the different value representation: numerical, alphabetical, exponential and date/time expressions.

Finally we support the identification of the "quantified" substance related to the measure, e.g. _silicon nitride powder_ in

As the other GROBID models, the module relies only on machine learning and uses linear CRF. 
The normalisation is handled by the java library [Units of measurement](http://unitsofmeasurement.github.io/).  

## Documentation

You can find the latest documentation [here](http://grobid-quantities.readthedocs.io). 

## Evaluation
The results (Precision, Recall, F-score) for all the models have been obtained using 10-fold cross-validation (average metrics over the 10 folds). 
We also indicate the best and worst results over the 10 folds in the complete result page.

The current aveages results have been calculated using micro average which provides more realistic results by giving different weights to labels based on their frequency.
The [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3342558.3345411) "Automatic Identification and Normalisation of Physical Measurements in Scientific Literature", published in September 2019 reported average evaluation based on macro average.
