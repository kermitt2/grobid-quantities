<text xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cabozantinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at <quantifiedObject id="39474a47-bd68-43c2-a34a-c4dd00bf043e">a dose of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#39474a47-bd68-43c2-a34a-c4dd00bf043e">60 mg/day</measure>. As with other TKIs, cabozantinib is associated with high interpatient variability in drug clearance and exposure that can significantly impact safety and tolerability across a patient population. To optimize cabozantinib exposure (maintaining efficacy and tolerability) for the individual, patients may require treatment interruption with <quantifiedObject id="31c6ea1d-4590-46bf-88b1-13c87b0b5852">dose reduction</quantifiedObject> (<measure type="value" ptr="#31c6ea1d-4590-46bf-88b1-13c87b0b5852">40 mg/day</measure> and then <measure type="value">20 mg/day</measure>). In the pivotal Phase 3 METEOR trial, cabozantinib significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival and the objective response rate compared with everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received previous treatment with a VEGFR TKI. Dose reductions were common for <quantifiedObject id="3f40383f-1a13-45f8-bc3a-d1f8a6689ec3">patients receiving</quantifiedObject> cabozantinib (<measure type="value" ptr="#3f40383f-1a13-45f8-bc3a-d1f8a6689ec3">60%</measure>) but effective as only <measure type="value">9%</measure> discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). In this review, we discuss pharmacometric analyses that evaluated the impact of cabozantinib dose on efficacy and safety outcomes during the METEOR study. Exposure-response models demonstrate that the risk of experiencing adverse events and dose reduction is increased in patients with low cabozantinib clearance versus typical clearance and decreased in patients with high clearance. Dose reduction of cabozantinib to manage AEs is predicted to have minimal impact on efficacy as AEs are more likely to occur in patients with low clearance and higher exposure to cabozantinib. These analyses further support a dose modification strategy to optimize cabozantinib exposure for individual patients.</p><p>Cabozantinib is an oral TKI that inhibits VEGFR as well as the novel targets MET and AXL, which are implicated in RCC growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance [1].

In these studies, cabozantinib demonstrated clinical benefit over existing standards of care with a safety and tolerability profile that was manageable with dose modification. Dose modification is a common strategy with TKI therapy to balance efficacy and tolerability. TKIs, including cabozantinib, are associated with high interpatient variability in drug clearance [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Variability in clearance leads to wide ranges in steady-state exposure to the drug. Generally, patients start TKI treatment at the recommended dose, and if needed, the dose is reduced to address overexposure and resolve intolerable adverse events (AEs). However, there is some concern that dose reduction may impact efficacy. It is, therefore, essential to develop informed strategies to optimize the dose for the individual patient.</p><p>For both the METEOR and CABOSUN studies, cabozantinib was administered orally at a dose of <measure type="value">60 mg/day</measure>, with dose interruptions and reductions to <measure type="interval">40</measure> and <measure type="value">20 mg/day</measure> recommended to manage AEs [2,4].
