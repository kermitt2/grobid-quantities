        <p>Cabozantinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at a dose of <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>. As with other TKIs, cabozantinib is associated with high interpatient variability in drug clearance and exposure that can significantly impact safety and tolerability across a patient population. To optimize cabozantinib exposure (maintaining efficacy and tolerability) for the individual, patients may require treatment interruption with dose reduction (<measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> and then <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>). In the pivotal Phase 3 METEOR trial, cabozantinib significantly improved overall survival, progression-free survival and the objective response rate compared with everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received previous treatment with a VEGFR TKI. Dose reductions were common for patients receiving cabozantinib (<measure type="value"><num>60</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) but effective as only <measure type="value"><num>9</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). In this review, we discuss pharmacometric analyses that evaluated the impact of cabozantinib dose on efficacy and safety outcomes during the METEOR study. Exposure-response models demonstrate that the risk of experiencing adverse events and dose reduction is increased in patients with low cabozantinib clearance versus typical clearance and decreased in patients with high clearance. Dose reduction of cabozantinib to manage AEs is predicted to have minimal impact on efficacy as AEs are more likely to occur in patients with low clearance and higher exposure to cabozantinib. These analyses further support a dose modification strategy to optimize cabozantinib exposure for individual patients.</p>
        <p>Cabozantinib is an oral TKI that inhibits VEGFR as well as the novel targets MET and AXL, which are implicated in RCC growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance [1]. Based on positive data from the phase 3 METEOR study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01865747) in patients previously treated with at least <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="one">one</num></measure> antiangiogenic agent and the randomized phase 2 CABOSUN study (NCT01835158) in treatment-na√Øve patients with intermediate-or poor-risk disease [2][3][4][5], cabozantinib has become a standard of care for advanced RCC [6,7]. In these studies, cabozantinib demonstrated clinical benefit over existing standards of care with a safety and tolerability profile that was manageable with dose modification. Dose modification is a common strategy with TKI therapy to balance efficacy and tolerability. TKIs, including cabozantinib, are associated with high interpatient variability in drug clearance [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Variability in clearance leads to wide ranges in steady-state exposure to the drug. Generally, patients start TKI treatment at the recommended dose, and if needed, the dose is reduced to address overexposure and resolve intolerable adverse events (AEs). However, there is some concern that dose reduction may impact efficacy. It is, therefore, essential to develop informed strategies to optimize the dose for the individual patient.</p>
        <p>For both the METEOR and CABOSUN studies, cabozantinib was administered orally at a dose of <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, with dose interruptions and reductions to <measure type="list"><num atMost="40">40</num></measure> and <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> recommended to manage AEs [2,4]. The <measure type="value"><num>60</num>-<measure type="?">mg/day</measure></measure> dose was selected based on the activity, safety, and tolerability of cabozantinib in a phase 1 trial of patients with previously treated metastatic RCC and studies of cabozantinib in other solid tumors [24,25]. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes outcomes from key clinical studies of cabozantinib in RCC. In the pivotal phase 3 METEOR study, cabozantinib was compared with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who had received prior therapy with a VEGFR TKI (N = <measure type="value"><num>658</num></measure>) [2,3]. Cabozantinib improved progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent review committee (IRC) relative to everolimus (median <measure type="list"><num>7.4</num> vs <num>3.9</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="months">months</measure></measure>; hazard ratio [HR] <measure type="value"><num>0.51</num></measure>; <measure type="value"><num>95</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> confidence interval [CI] <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.41">0.41</num>-<num atMost="0.62">0.62</num></measure>; p &lt; <measure type="interval"><num atMost="0.0001">0.0001</num></measure>), as well as overall survival (OS) (median <measure type="list"><num>21.4</num> vs <num>16.5</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="months">months</measure></measure>; HR <measure type="value"><num>0.66</num></measure>; <measure type="value"><num>95</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> CI <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.53">0.53</num>-<num atMost="0.83">0.83</num></measure>; p = <measure type="value"><num>0.00026</num></measure>) and the objective response rate (ORR) (<measure type="value"><num>17</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> vs <measure type="value"><num>3</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>; p &lt; <measure type="interval"><num atMost="0.0001">0.0001</num></measure>) [3]. In the phase 2 CABOSUN study, cabozantinib was compared with sunitinib as a first-line treatment in intermediate and poor-risk patients (per International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium [IMDC] criteria) with metastatic RCC (N = <measure type="value"><num>157</num></measure>) [4,5]. PFS assessed by IRC was significantly longer with cabozantinib than with sunitinib at <measure type="value"><num>8.6</num> versus <num>5.3</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="months">months</measure></measure> (HR <measure type="value"><num>0.48</num></measure>; <measure type="value"><num>95</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> CI <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.31">0.31</num>-<num atMost="0.74">0.74</num></measure>; p = <measure type="value"><num>0.0008</num></measure>), with a corresponding ORR of <measure type="value"><num>20</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> versus <measure type="value"><num>9</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> [5].</p>

        <p>The safety and tolerability profile of cabozantinib was consistent across the METEOR and CABOSUN studies. In the METEOR study, the most commonly reported AEs of any grade were diarrhea (<measure type="value"><num>74</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), fatigue (<measure type="value"><num>56</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), nausea (<measure type="value"><num>50</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), decreased appetite (<measure type="value"><num>46</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE, <measure type="value"><num>42</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), and hypertension (<measure type="value"><num>37</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>); and the most common grade 3/4 AEs were hypertension (<measure type="value"><num>15</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), diarrhea (<measure type="value"><num>11</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), fatigue (<measure type="value"><num>9</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), and PPE (<measure type="value"><num>8</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) [2]. Cabozantinib dose reductions were frequently employed to manage AEs [2][3][4][5]. In METEOR, <measure type="value"><num>40</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> of patients receiving cabozantinib maintained the <measure type="value"><num>60</num>-<measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> dose, while <measure type="value"><num>60</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> required at least <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1">1</num> dose reduction to <num atMost="40">40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> and <measure type="value"><num>20</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> required a second dose reduction to <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> [2,26]. AEs that led to cabozantinib dose reduction included diarrhea (<measure type="value"><num>16</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), PPE (<measure type="value"><num>11</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), fatigue (<measure type="value"><num>10</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), and hypertension (<measure type="value"><num>8</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>). While dose reductions were more frequent with cabozantinib than with everolimus (<measure type="value"><num>60</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> vs <measure type="value"><num>25</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>), the rates of discontinuation due to AEs were similar (<measure type="value"><num>9</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> vs <measure type="value"><num>10</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>).</p>
        <p>Cabozantinib PK has been characterized in healthy volunteers and in patients with various solid tumors, including RCC. In healthy volunteers receiving a single 20-, <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="40">40</num></measure>-, or <measure type="list"><num>60</num></measure>-mg dose of cabozantinib, maximum plasma concentrations were reached in 3 to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="4">4</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="h">h</measure></measure> with a mean maximum plasma concentration of <measure type="value"><num>343</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/mL">ng/mL</measure></measure> at the <measure type="value"><num>60</num>-<measure type="MASS" unit="mg">mg</measure></measure> dose [8,27]. With daily oral dosing, the median time to steady-state cabozantinib concentration in patients with solid tumors is approximately <measure type="value"><num>15</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="days">days</measure></measure> with a 4-to <measure type="value"><num>5-fold</num></measure> mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on area under the curve) compared with single-dose administration [28].</p>
        <p>Cabozantinib clearance is variable. Cabozantinib is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 pathway and to a far lesser extent by CYP2C9, with a relatively long terminal half-life (99-<measure type="interval"><num atMost="120">120</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="h">h</measure></measure>). Food intake, hepatic impairment, and concomitant use of medications that inhibit or induce the CYP3A4 pathway are known to affect cabozantinib plasma concentrations [29][30][31][32]. In healthy volunteers administered <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="MASS" unit="mg">mg</measure></measure>, the average clearance was 2.35 L/h with a coefficient of variability (CV) of <measure type="value"><num>67</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> [27].</p>
        <p>Generally, the PK characteristics of cabozantinib in patients with advanced RCC are consistent with those of healthy volunteers (Table 1). As part of the METEOR study, plasma samples were obtained for PK assessments from patients assigned to the cabozantinib treatment arm, and a popPK model was developed using data from METEOR patients along with healthy volunteers [18,33]. The estimated terminal half-life for patients with RCC was <measure type="value"><num>99</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="h">h</measure></measure>. Cabozantinib clearance was variable, with a predicted range of <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.51">0.51</num> to <num atMost="7.24">7.24</num></measure> L/h (Fig. 1A) [21] and an estimated CV of <measure type="value"><num>46</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> [26]. In a multiple covariate model, baseline patient characteristics such as age, body mass index, and baseline laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, serum albumin, and creatinine clearance did not have a statistically significant effect on clearance. Asian race and female gender were associated with lower cabozantinib clearance compared with their respective counterparts (reductions of <measure type="value"><num>‚àí 27</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> and <measure type="list"><num>‚àí 21</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>, respectively); however, these were deemed not clinically significant given the variability in clearance for the overall population [18,26].</p>
        <p>The relationship of cabozantinib clearance with dosing was explored using data from METEOR [21]. From the popPK model, clearance for a typical white male patient was estimated at <measure type="value"><num>2.23</num> <measure type="?" unit="L">L</measure></measure>/h [18]. Additional clearance values of <measure type="list"><num>1.3</num></measure> and 3.3 L/h were chosen to represent patients with low and high clearance characteristics, respectively (Fig. 1A) [21]. At the <measure type="value"><num>60</num></measure>-mg/day dose, the average plasma concentration of cabozantinib at steady state was estimated to be <measure type="value"><num>1122</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/mL">ng/mL</measure></measure> for patients with typical cabozantinib clearance (Fig. 1B), with the concentration increasing by <measure type="value"><num>+ 71</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> (<measure type="value"><num>1923</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/mL">ng/mL</measure></measure>) for patients with low clearance but decreasing by <measure type="value"><num>‚àí 32</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> (<measure type="value"><num>758</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/ml">ng/ml</measure></measure>) for patients with high clearance [21]. A stepwise dose reduction to <measure type="list"><num>40</num> or <num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> for a patient with lower clearance would bring exposure to a more typical level.</p>
        <p>The probability of dose modification during METEOR increased as clearance decreased; patients with low clearance had a high rate of dose modifications during the initial weeks of cabozantinib treatment (Fig. 1C) [20]. Furthermore, the subgroups of patients who dose-reduced to <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="40">40</num></measure>-or <measure type="list"><num>20</num>-<measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> dose levels showed higher initial exposure compared with those who did not (data on file) (Fig. 1D). With dose reductions, predicted median cabozantinib exposure across the entire treated population was lowered from a median of <measure type="value"><num>1340</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/mL">ng/mL</measure></measure> at the initial 60-mg/day dose to a median of <measure type="value"><num>957</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/mL">ng/mL</measure></measure> when estimated at the final dose level of each patient (Fig. 1E), with a corresponding reduction in the standard deviation from ng/mL to <measure type="value"><num>414</num> <measure type="?" unit="ng/mL">ng/mL</measure></measure> (data on file).</p>
        <p>Initial ER models were developed to characterize the relationship of cabozantinib dose with outcomes during METEOR for patients with typical baseline characteristics and clearance [20]. Given the scope of this review, we have limited our discussion on ER methodology, but detailed methods are described by Lacy et al. [20]. Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazards for PFS and select AEs across the <measure type="value"><num>60</num></measure>-, <measure type="list"><num>40</num></measure>, and 20-mg/day dosing options. Given the variability in cabozantinib clearance and its relationship with exposure and dose modification, ER models were then extended to evaluate the relationship of cabozantinib dose with outcomes across the spectrum of patients with varying clearance values. The models compared <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="60">60</num></measure>-and <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="40">40</num></measure>-mg/day doses in patients with low (1.3 L/h), typical (2.23 L/h), and high clearance (3.3 L/h) [20,21].</p>
        <p>For the typical patient, starting cabozantinib at a lower dose of <measure type="list"><num>20</num> or <num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> was predicted to increase the hazard of disease progression or death compared with a <measure type="value"><num>60</num>-<measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> dose (Fig. 2) [20]. A dose of <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> was predicted to have notable impact, with a <measure type="value"><num>+39</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> hazard increase for PFS compared with a dose of <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, while the predicted hazard increase for a dose of <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> versus <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> was limited at <measure type="value"><num>+10</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>. Results from tumor response models were consistent with PFS estimates. The predicted ORR for patients with typical clearance was <measure type="value"><num>8.7</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> at a <measure type="value"><num>20</num>-<measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> dose, <measure type="value"><num>15.6</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> at <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, and <measure type="value"><num>19.1</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> at <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>; and in a tumor growth model, the predicted median change in tumor size from baseline was <measure type="value"><num>‚àí4.5</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>, ‚àí<measure type="interval"><num atMost="9.1">9.1</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure>, and <num atLeast="‚àí11.9">‚àí11.9</num></measure>%, respectively [20].</p>
        <p>Exposure-response models for safety focused on select AEs associated with dose modification, including PPE (grade ‚â• 1), fatigue/ asthenia (grade ‚â• 3), diarrhea (grade ‚â• 3), and hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="160">160</num></measure> mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="100">100</num></measure> mmHg). For the typical patient, a higher cabozantinib dose was predicted to increase the risk of AEs [19][20][21] When ER modeling is extended to include both lower and higher cabozantinib clearance values, the impact of dose modification on outcomes becomes more well defined. Reducing the dose is predicted to have a modest impact on PFS (HR = <measure type="value"><num>1.06</num></measure>) for patients with lower clearance, while substantially improving AE tolerability (Fig. 3). The hazard rate of PPE, for example, was predicted to decrease by <measure type="value"><num>‚àí49</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> with a dose of <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> versus <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> for patients with low cabozantinib clearance. Conversely, for patients with higher clearance, use of the <measure type="value"><num>40</num></measure>-mg/day dose has a more noticeable impact on PFS compared with <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> (HR = <measure type="value"><num>1.13</num></measure>), with a corresponding decrease of <measure type="value"><num>‚àí24</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> in the hazard rate of PPE [21].</p>
        <p>Clinicians are faced with a number of challenges for treating individual patients with advanced RCC. Patients are often older, present with comorbidities, and are receiving multiple concomitant medications [36][37][38]. The cabozantinib label provides guidance on dosing and dose modification based on adverse events, food intake, concomitant medications, and hepatic impairment (Box 2). Prior to starting patients on cabozantinib, it is important for clinicians to conduct a thorough medical examination, including an assessment of medical history, Fig. 2.

Clinicians should identify concomitant medications that induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 pathway [6,7]. Strong CYP3A4 modifiers should be avoided, and patients should be switched to alternate medications that have no or minimal CYP3A4 modification whenever possible. If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 modifier cannot be avoided, then the cabozantinib dose should be adjusted as indicated per the US label (note the European Summary of Product Characteristics does not include recommendations for dose adjustments based on potential</p>
        <p>Because of the interpatient variability in clearance (CV of <measure type="value"><num>46</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) and exposure, clinicians should anticipate that many patients receiving cabozantinib will require dose modifications to manage exposure and tolerability. The most common AEs associated with cabozantinib generally emerge within <measure type="value"><num>3-5</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="weeks">weeks</measure></measure> of treatment initiation and are likely a marker of low cabozantinib clearance and high exposure [26,39].

Corresponding to the early onset of AEs, the median time to first dose reduction was <measure type="value"><num>7.9</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="weeks">weeks</measure></measure> (range, <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1.4">1.4</num>-<num atMost="50.7">50.7</num></measure>), and median time to second dose reduction was <measure type="value"><num>13.3</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="weeks">weeks</measure></measure> (range, <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="4.1">4.1</num>-<num atMost="45.3">45.3</num></measure>) [26]. Given that the time to steady-state concentration for cabozantinib is~15 days with a relatively long halflife of~99 h, dose interruption until resolution or improvement is appropriate prior to dose reduction. Clinicians should be mindful that some AEs can be more readily managed with supportive care than others. The ratio of patients requiring a dose reduction for an AE to the total number of patients experiencing the AE (any grade) was <measure type="value"><num>38/139</num></measure> (<measure type="value"><num>27</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) for PPE, <measure type="value"><num>54/245</num></measure> (<measure type="value"><num>22</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) for diarrhea, <measure type="value"><num>25/122</num></measure> (<measure type="value"><num>20</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) for hypertension, and <measure type="value"><num>33/186</num></measure> (<measure type="value"><num>18</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) for fatigue [26].</p>
        <p>A number of prophylactic and supportive care measures can be implemented to mitigate the risk and severity of some of the more common side effects, including PPE, fatigue, gastrointestinal events, and hypertension [39,40]. Clinicians should identify any potential drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications prior to treatment initiation [39,41,42]. Cabozantinib does not have a clinically significant effect on QTc interval; and therefore, coadministration with QTc-prolonging agents such as antiemetic therapy with serotonin inhibitors is not contraindicated. Clinicians should consider monitoring patients with a history of QT interval prolongation or at-risk patients (eg, patients with relevant cardiac disease) during cabozantinib treatment [6,7,<measure type="list"><num>29</num></measure>,41,43].</p>
        <p>Currently, there is no strong evidence to support dose adjustments based on age, sex, or race [18,33]. However, in a subgroup analysis of METEOR outcomes by age, AEs emerged more rapidly in a small subgroup of elderly patients (n = <measure type="value"><num>27</num></measure>) receiving cabozantinib compared with younger patients; and elderly patients required more frequent dose reductions. The median time to a grade ‚â• <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="3">3</num></measure> AE was <measure type="value"><num>3.4</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="weeks">weeks</measure></measure> for patients ‚â• <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="years">years</num></measure> of age versus <measure type="value"><num>16.1</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="weeks">weeks</measure></measure> for patients <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="65">65</num>-<num atMost="74">74</num> <measure type="TIME" unit="years">years</measure></measure> of age, and the corresponding rates of dose reduction were <measure type="value"><num>85</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> versus <measure type="value"><num>61</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure> [44]. These data suggest reducing the initial dose of cabozantinib based on age may be warranted, but additional data are needed to support a clinical recommendation. Regardless, hepatic function should be assessed as elderly patients can have reduced liver mass and hepatic function [45], and older patients should be closely monitored for Box 1 Cabozantinib Exposure-Response (ER) Summary and Recommendations.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Patients with high cabozantinib clearance are less likely to experience an AE that requires dose modification during the early months of treatment. These patients should be maintained at the <measure type="value"><num>60</num>-<measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> dose as tolerated.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Patients with typical cabozantinib clearance are likely to experience an AE that requires dose modification during the early months of treatment. The dose should be reduced to <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> when needed to improve tolerability. ER modeling predicts that dose reduction to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="40">40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> will not have a clinically significant impact on efficacy. Further dose reduction to <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> may be necessary to improve longterm tolerability for a minority of treated patients.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Patients with low cabozantinib clearance are at high risk of experiencing an AE that requires dose modification during the early months of treatment. These patients may require a second-level dose reduction to <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>. At <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, cabozantinib exposure for a patient with low clearance is comparable to exposure for a patient with typical clearance receiving <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> or for a patient with high clearance receiving <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Dose reduction to <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> may negatively impact efficacy for patients with high or typical cabozantinib clearance. The <measure type="value"><num>20</num>-<measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> dose should be used only in patients for whom <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> is intolerable; this intolerability is likely associated with low clearance and dose reduction should have a minimal effect on efficacy.</p>
        <p>Cabozantinib Dosing Recommendations [6,7] ‚Ä¢ The approved dose for cabozantinib is <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, which should be maintained during the course of treatment as tolerated.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Cabozantinib should be administered at least <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="1">1</num></measure> h before or at least <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="2">2</num></measure> h after eating.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Grade 1/2 adverse events (AEs) can often be managed with supportive care. Cabozantinib should be held if a patient experiences an intolerable grade 2 AE, a grade 3/4 AE, or osteonecrosis of the jaw (a rare [ &lt; <measure type="interval"><num atMost="1">1</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>] but serious event). Once the AE has resolved to grade 1 or to baseline level, cabozantinib should be restarted at a dose reduced by <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>. If the previous dose was <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, patients should be restarted at <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> or cabozantinib should be discontinued.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Clinicians should be aware of factors that can modify cabozantinib exposure. Cabozantinib is metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway; therefore, patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose lowered by <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>, while those receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers should have the dose increased by <measure type="value"><num>20</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure>. If the concomitant medication is discontinued, the cabozantinib dose should be adjusted appropriately after a 2-3-day washout period.</p>
        <p>‚Ä¢ Per the US FDA prescribing information, patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) should have their dose reduced to <measure type="value"><num>40</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> given the potential for increased exposure, and these patients should be closely monitored. (Note that the European Summary of Product Characteristics does not recommend dose adjustments for moderate hepatic impairment due to limited data). Cabozantinib should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).</p>
        <p>Clinical data and ER modeling support cabozantinib at a dose of <measure type="value"><num>60</num> <measure type="?" unit="mg/day">mg/day</measure></measure> for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC, with a dose modification strategy to manage AEs. Because of interpatient variability in cabozantinib clearance, clinicians should anticipate that many patients may experience AEs during the early months of treatment. Grade 1 or 2 AEs can often be managed with supportive care alone, but intolerable grade 2 or grade 3/4 AEs require prompt dose interruption and subsequent reduction. Judicious use of dose modification in patients experiencing adverse events is expected to improve overall tolerability with a minimal impact on efficacy outcomes. The dose should be adjusted as indicated for patients receiving concomitant medication with strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, or for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (per the US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information [6]). Clinicians may also consider patient age prior to starting cabozantinib. Adverse events may occur earlier in older patients, and these patients should be monitored closely and dose reductions implemented expeditiously.</p>
